"""Session permission gating for tool calls.

Skill-agnostic policy shared by the runtime (``_build_allowed_tools`` strips
write tools under ``plan``) and the ``can_use_tool`` confirmation callback
(``default``/``acceptEdits`` route write/high-risk tools through user
confirmation). The high-risk and write tool sets are the single source of
truth; any agent or MCP server can register tools here without the runtime
learning their business meaning.

Tool names are matched against both the bare MCP tool name (e.g.
``portal_publish_workflow``) and the MCP-qualified form
(``mcp__portal__portal_publish_workflow``).

    approved; after approval the run switches to acceptEdits where they auto-allow.

    ``Bash`` is deliberately not denied: it is the read-only research vector (skill
    scripts, read-only SQL) and is auto-allowed upstream via ``allowed_tools`` (the
    callback never sees it), and its filesystem writes are confined by the runtime
    boundary hook to the ephemeral per-topic workspace plus the deployment's declared
    scratch dirs (``dataagent_workspace_scratch_dirs``, ``/tmp`` by default, and in
    sandbox mode a per-container tmpfs). This is an accepted trust
    boundary, not a hard guarantee: the sandbox forwards DB/portal credentials
    (``MYSQL_`` / ``DATAAGENT_PORTAL_`` / ``ODW_`` env) into the child, so Bash could
